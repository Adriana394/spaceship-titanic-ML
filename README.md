# spaceship-titanic-ML
 Machine learning project for the Kaggle Spaceship Titanic dataset, aiming to predict whether passengers were transported to another dimension. This project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training with Logistic Regression and XGBoost. Hyperparameter tuning and feature selection were applied to optimize accuracy.
